# ü©∫ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical factors. By leveraging supervised classification algorithms, this tool can serve as an early-warning system, helping users assess their risk and seek medical attention sooner.

This project is built in Python and follows the standard machine learning workflow from data collection to model evaluation.

## üéØ Real-World Applications

The insights from this model can be applied in several ways:

  * **Clinical Support:** Assists doctors in emergencies by providing a rapid risk assessment for hidden heart diseases.
  * **Personal Health:** Allows individuals to monitor their health for early detection and proactive care.
  * **Hospital Integration:** Can be integrated into clinical decision support systems to help medical staff assess patient risk using their electronic health data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

  * **Language:** Python 3.x
  * **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
  * **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
  * **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## üìà Project Workflow

The project is broken down into the following key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (specifically the Cleveland Clinic dataset).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling any missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare them for the model.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data with Matplotlib and Seaborn to discover patterns, correlations, and insights between different medical features.
4.  **Feature Engineering & Scaling:** Transforming features and scaling them (e.g., using `StandardScaler`) for optimal model performance.
5.  **Train/Test Split:** Dividing the data into training and testing sets to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen data.
6.  **Model Training:** Training multiple supervised learning models (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**) on the training data.
7.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance on the test data using key classification metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and the **F1-Score**.
